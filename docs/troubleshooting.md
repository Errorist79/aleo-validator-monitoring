# Troubleshooting

This document provides solutions to common issues that may arise when running the Aleo Network Monitor.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Database Connection Errors

**Symptom**: The application fails to start with database connection errors.

**Possible Solutions**:
- Check if the PostgreSQL service is running.
- Verify the database connection string in the `.env` file.
- Ensure the database user has the necessary permissions.

### 2. Block Synchronization Issues

**Symptom**: The application is not syncing new blocks or is syncing slowly.

**Possible Solutions**:
- Check the network connection to the Aleo blockchain.
- Verify the `ALEO_NETWORK_TYPE` in the `.env` file.
- Increase the `concurrencyLimit` in the configuration if the system resources allow.

### 3. High CPU Usage

**Symptom**: The application is using an unusually high amount of CPU resources.

**Possible Solutions**:
- Check for any infinite loops in custom code.
- Optimize database queries, especially those in frequently called functions.
- Consider increasing the interval between synchronization attempts.

### 4. Memory Leaks

**Symptom**: The application's memory usage grows over time without bounds.

**Possible Solutions**:
- Use a memory profiler to identify the source of the leak.
- Check for any resources that are not being properly released, especially in long-running processes.
- Implement proper error handling to ensure resources are released even in failure scenarios.

### 5. API Endpoint Errors

**Symptom**: Certain API endpoints are returning errors or unexpected results.

**Possible Solutions**:
- Check the server logs for specific error messages.
- Verify that the required data is present in the database.
- Ensure that the API routes are correctly defined and mapped to the appropriate controller functions.

## Logging

To assist with troubleshooting, the application uses Winston for logging. Logs are written to:

- `error.log`: For error-level logs
- `combined.log`: For all logs

Check these log files for detailed error messages and stack traces.

## Debugging

For more in-depth debugging:

1. Use the `debug` npm package to add additional debug logging.
2. Run the application in debug mode:
   ```
   node --inspect dist/index.js
   ```
3. Connect to the debugger using Chrome DevTools or your preferred IDE.
